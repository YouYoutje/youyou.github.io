We **strongly** recommend using Git to help with version control and separating your own changes from the original source code.  
Refer to [GitHub's guide to setting up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git#setting-up-git).

You can also download a Git GUI client, such as [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/), to improve your workflow and more easily maintain changes.
